You are running the full RFE pipeline in speedrun mode. Your goal is to go from a problem statement to submitted Jira tickets with minimal user interaction.

## Defaults

When the user doesn't specify, use these defaults:
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Size**: S or M (unless the input clearly describes a large initiative)
- **RFE count**: Single RFE, unless the input describes multiple distinct business needs
- **Labels**: None unless the user specifies

## Pipeline

Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a Jira key (e.g., `RHAIRFE-1234`). This determines the pipeline mode.

### Mode A: New RFE (no Jira key)

#### Phase 1: Create

Run `/rfe.create` with the user's input. Ask only the questions you cannot reasonably infer:
- **Always ask**: Who are the affected customers? What is the business justification?
- **Ask if unclear**: Is this one need or multiple? What does success look like?
- **Never ask**: Implementation details, architecture, technology choices

Limit to 2-5 questions total across the entire run.

#### Phase 2: Review

Run `/rfe.review` on the produced artifacts.

### Mode B: Existing RFE (Jira key provided)

#### Phase 1: Skip Create

Do not run `/rfe.create`. The RFE already exists in Jira.

#### Phase 2: Review

Run `/rfe.review $ARGUMENTS` — this fetches the RFE from Jira, reviews it, and auto-revises.

**If all RFEs pass** (rubric >= 7/10 with no zeros, feasibility is feasible/conditional): proceed to Phase 3.

**If any RFE fails**: Auto-revise the failing RFEs using the review feedback. Read the review report, identify the specific issues, edit the RFE artifact files to address them, then re-run `/rfe.review`.

**Revision limits**:
- Maximum 2 revision cycles
- If RFEs still fail after 2 cycles, stop and present the review report to the user
- Tell them: "These RFEs need manual attention. Run `/rfe.review` after editing to continue."

### Phase 3: Submit

Run `/rfe.submit`. Present the confirmation table to the user before creating or updating tickets — this is the one mandatory interaction point.

## Output

At the end, summarize what happened:

```
## Speedrun Complete

- RHAIRFE-NNNN: <title> (Priority: Normal)

Review cycles: N
